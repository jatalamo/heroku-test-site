    <h3>Thanks for your interest in learning about me! <img src="about-me.jpg" height="160" align="left" >I am excited to share a bit about my life and my journey as a Rutger's Web Development Programming student at the age of 50!</h3>
    <p>
    I am New Jersey native and have lived here most of my life, <img src="Jill.png" align="right" > (except for 5 years where I lived in Mississippi & New Orleans.) I am married to Joe, have 2 children, Joey and Gigi and we live in Hillsborough, New Jersey. We have 3 rescued dogs and I am a very active animal rescue volunteer. Helping dogs and abused farm animals is one of my passions! I also love to travel and bring my kids to unique places each year.<i> "Never the same vacation twice until you've seen it all"</i> is my motto! For fun, I am a novice author of a blog entitled "Things I saw Today" where I simply "Stop & Smell the Roses of Daily life." You'll pretty much be walking in my shoes! I hope you will check it out!</p>

    My first career was in the Hotel/Casino Industry, lasting 15 years and spanning three states. I was a Blackjack and Baccarat Dealer, Supervisor, Trainer and finally, a Manager. It was alot of fun, but I needed creativity. With the help and advice of several family members in the Programming field, In 1998 I decided on a career change into Computer Programming. I attended The Chubb Institute of Computer Programming for their one-year training course where I achieved the status of "Honor Student." I learned COBOL, JCL, Visual Basic and some other now outdated stuff! I knew I found my passion! Upon graduation, I was hired by Prudential Financial as a PeopleSoft Analyst. At the same time, I was newly married and the following year, welcomed the arrival of my first child. Faced with a really touch choice,  I decided to stay home, raise kids and forego my new career. I felt lucky to even have this option, as so many moms don't!...And time slipped away, until now, 15 years later! </p>

    I never forgot about programming and the sense of accomplishment it gave me and knew I would return to it "one day". Well, "one day" is Now! I am thrilled to be a student again, at Rutger's, learning Full-Stack Web Development including: HTML5, CSS3, FTP, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, Database Theory, ActiveRecord, Command Line, Git, and Collaborative Software Development. 

    <p>With nothing to stop me now, I truly am looking forward to getting back out into the professional world and contributing my creative passion and talent to the universe.  I'm excited!<strong> Programming, I have missed you!</strong>
